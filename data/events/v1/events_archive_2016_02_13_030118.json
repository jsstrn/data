That’s right above the City Hall MRT, an ideal location if you’re having meetings in the city. In order to get in from the MRT, you’re going to have to go around to the office tower. The visitor entrance is down the street from the taxi stand facing Chijmes on North Bridge Road. Head straight to the lobby reception and tell them you are a guest of Vertex and attending an event. They will get your ID and issue you a temporary card. Take the card and scan it into the visitor gate and proceed to the 5th floor. Head to unit 05-03. There you’ll find the Tech Circle space. The space When you reach the space, normally you will need some fancy software to open the door. This time, simply walk right in as we're waiting to let you in. Hope to see you there :)","location":"Technopreneur Circle, SINGAPORE  250 North Bridge Road, #05-01  Raffles City Tower,  Singapore 179101 ","latitude":1.293497,"longitude":103.852783,"rsvp_count":2,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/Personalized-Eyewear/events/228343958/","group_id":16241232,"group_name":"Personalized Eyewear","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Personalized-Eyewear","formatted_time":"13 Feb 2016, Sat, 10:30 am","start_time":"2016-02-13T02:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-02-13T05:30:00.000Z"},{"id":"540004059495159","name":"Introduction to HTML / CSS - Hackerschool","description":"Want to make a website, but found w3c's tutorials too boring? \n\nWe'll teach you HTML and CSS from scratch.
