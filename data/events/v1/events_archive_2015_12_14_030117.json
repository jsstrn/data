But how do you get your hands dirty to create the immersiveness that has been promised by VR? At this month's Meetup we will examine two types of content creation for VR, 360 video and 3D engine. 360 video content creation is basically a video recording of a real world scene, where the view in every direction is recorded at the same time. 3D engine content creation is the creation of an interactive 3d world using 3D engine like unity to let player move around and interact with the 3d objects. The event will start off with VR project showcase from local content developers or demo of interesting VR/AR projects by volunteers, to be followed by talks about 360 video and 3d engine content creation. Join our guest speakers to find out what the future holds for Virtual Reality content creation. Agenda 7.00pm - VR Project showcases We will setup tables for local VR developers to showcase their VR game, apps or website and volunteers to showcase VR devices or VR game/app/website that they found.  1.
