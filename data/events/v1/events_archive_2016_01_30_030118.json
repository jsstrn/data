DataKind SG invites you to join our DataJam on Sunday January 30, running from 11 am to 5 PM. We've identified a promising project in need of help from data science volunteers like yourself. Founded in 2011 and based in Hong Kong, Project Share is dedicated to increasing social mobility of young people living in disadvantaged areas of Hong Kong. The goal is to clean up and explore a dataset of survey results of 2000 underprivileged kids in Hong Kong. Space is limited, so RSVP now!  And if you later cannot make it, please RSVP \"no\" so others can join!  Thanks in advance for the calendar kindness as well as your data kindness!","location":"Selfish Gene, 40 craig road, 089678, Singapore","latitude":1.277983,"longitude":103.842636,"rsvp_count":20,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/DataKind-SG/events/228110613/","group_id":16412132,"group_name":"DataKind SG","group_url":"http://meetup.com/DataKind-SG","formatted_time":"30 Jan 2016, Sat, 11:00 am","start_time":"2016-01-30T03:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-01-30T09:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"1534648550178942","name":"Conversations: Dr Peter Jenni - the Story of the LHC Project, the Higgs Discovery and Beyond","description":"Esteemed experimental particle physicist Dr. Peter Jenni sheds light on the world of ATLAS at CERN and takes us on the journey culminating in the discovery of the Higgs Boson.\n\nProgramme:\n2.00pm- Welcome and Introduction \n2.05pm-  Talk by Dr. Peter Jenni, Former ATLAS Collaboration Spokesperson, Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg (Germany) and CERN (Geneva, Switzerland)\n2.55pm - Question & Answer\n\nSince 2010, the experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have been studying particle physics at the highest collision energies ever achieved in a laboratory. A rich harvest of physics has resulted, including measurements of countless processes of the Standard Model (SM), and in July 2012, the ground-breaking discovery of the long-awaited Higgs boson by the ATLAS and CMS experiments. This new, heavy particle is the keystone of the SM and is fundamental to the understanding of Nature. Although the discovery of the Higgs boson completes the particle content of the SM, it is considered to be a low energy manifestation of a more complete theory – physics beyond the SM is therefore widely anticipated.\nIn the summer of 2015, the LHC restarted operation at even higher collision energy, with the exciting prospects of discovering physics beyond the SM, including that of the elucidation of the mystery of Dark Matter in the Universe, which could be related to a theoretically proposed overarching symmetry in particle physics, called Supersymmetry (SUSY). \nDr Peter Jenni’s talk will trace the history of the LHC Project, the accelerator and the associated general-purpose experiments, the discovery of the Higgs boson and the outlook. It will illustrate the main ideas, technical challenges and achievements of this incredible scientific and human adventure that already spans three decades, without requiring any expert knowledge. \n\nBiography:\nDr Peter Jenni participated in CERN experiments at the Synchro-Cyclotron (1972/3), at the Proton Synchrotron (1974/6), and as ETHZ Research Associate at the Intersecting Storage Rings (1976/7), the first high-energy hadron collider. During 1978/9, he was a Research Associate at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Centre (SLAC), USA. He became a CERN staff in 1980 with the UA2 experiment at the SPS collider (major involvement in the discoveries of jets and the W/Z bosons). His strong interest was with the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) since the beginning in 1984. From 1991 the main activities concentrated on tasks related to the informal spokespersonship first of a LHC proto-Collaboration. In 1995, after formal approval of the ATLAS project, he was elected Spokesperson (project leader) of the experiment, which today comprises some 3000 scientists representing 178 Institutions from 39 countries. He was re-elected several times and retired from this duty in February 2009, retaining however a strong involvement in the experiment. \nSince his retirement as a CERN Senior Research Staff end of April 2013, Peter Jenni is a Guest Scientist and Honorary Professor with the Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg, Germany, keeping his full engagement with the ATLAS experiment. He is a corresponding member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences.\nHe received, among others, the Swiss Greinacher Prize in 1998, the Slovak gold medal of the Comenius University in 1999, the Czech Charles University memorial silver medal in 2001, the Czech Academy of Sciences Ernst Mach Honorary Medal in 2012, and in 2013 the German Julius Wess Award.\n\nDr Peter Jenni’s visit is made possible by the Embassy of Switzerland in Singapore.","location":"ArtScience Museum","rsvp_count":74,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1534648550178942","group_name":"ArtScience Museum","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/156726297714355","formatted_time":"30 Jan 2016, Sat, 2:00 pm","start_time":"2016-01-30T06:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-01-30T07:00:00.000Z"}]}
