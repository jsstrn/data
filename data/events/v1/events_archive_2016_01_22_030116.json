We're kicking off Friday Hacks with a talk by a SoC student about his interesting side project with a Roomba. \n\nDate/Time: Friday, Jan 22 at 6:30pm \nFree pizza is served before the talks. \n\n# That Roomba Raspberry Pi Kinect Hack\n\nWhile procrastinating one day, Fazli thought it was a good idea to duct-tape a Kinect, a Raspberry Pi, a Roomba and an empty biscuit tin together. So, he went and duct-taped a Kinect, a Raspberry Pi, a Roomba and an empty biscuit tin together. It wasn’t such a great idea.\n\nCome to the talk anyway to see Fazli describe what he learnt during his miserable experience in agonizing detail. Also, witness live demos of his robot attempting Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) of a totally untested environment. What could possibly go wrong?\n\n# Speaker profile\n\nFazli Sapuan is a Year 4 CS student who likes to procrastinate and do stupid random stuff like duct-taping a Kinect, a Raspberry Pi, a Roomba and an empty biscuit tin together. His hobbies include: hacking stuff together, fountain pen collecting and not getting fined by the school for misconduct.","location":"Video Conference Room (COM1-02-13), School of Computing, National University of Singapore","rsvp_count":12,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1027250797369796","group_name":"NUS Hackers","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/164904410234667","formatted_time":"22 Jan 2016, Fri, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2016-01-22T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-01-22T12:30:00.000Z"},{"id":"128097757570005","name":"TGIFHacks #43","description":"Welcome back everyone!\n\nThis week, at TGIFHacks, we will be going back to an old favourite, Android App Development!\n\nThe mobile market (in which Android is the leader in terms of market share) has boomed in recent years and continues to grow. This makes Android application development a useful skill to have, not just for software developers, but for everyone in general.\n\nWe will be covering the basics of Android development. This session will be completely hands-on, which means you go home with a functioning Andoid app of your own.
