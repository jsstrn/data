Room Setup: Rounds Duration:[masked] minutes Keywords: change, Agile, Executives, SAFe, Enterprise, Transformation, Agility, Leaders, enterprise agile, scaled agile framework, Change-Management, containeering Abstract: \"No snowflake in an avalanche ever feels responsible\" - Voltaire Enterprise Agile Transformation initiatives are BIG. Change at this scale of thousands is tough. The Leaders, Executives and Internal Change Agents involved in these initiatives are going through their own personal transformation. Change at this scale of one is equally tough. The heart of enterprise agile that is transforming beats with the hearts of all the leaders, executives and internal change agents going through their own personal transformation. In working with hundreds of executives leading and internal change agents enabling the enterprise agile transformation initiatives, we have seen how the enterprise transformation happens when they bring their heart to the change initiative. These are their stories of personal growth and individuation. We will hear how transformation at a personal level is the leverage for transformation at a collective level. We will also learn of unique methods that activate personal transformation for leaders and change agents who are ready to step into their leader/change agent persona but are unable to get that from the current leadership offerings available in their context. Session Agenda: The delivery approach will be one of story telling with highly evocative visuals of actual case studies and enterprise agile transformation in action. I hope to engage the audience with these stories and make them ask questions during the session … and continue to ponder on these stories after the session. My intention is to empower leaders and change agents in the audience and call on them to take their game to the next level of bringing their heart to the game!

Ghost is an open source blogging platform launched through Kickstarter in 2013. They made community news last month when John announced that he's shutting down operations in the UK and reincorporating in Singapore. Ghost is a virtual and distributed company and will not actually set up a physical space here. This is a great opportunity to chat about open source software, running a virtual team, launching a successful kickstarter and more. Or if you're simply a satisfied Ghost user.
