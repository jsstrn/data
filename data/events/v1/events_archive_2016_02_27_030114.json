Following on the success of our last race gathering, we'll be revisiting the same location - great opportunity to take part if u missed it last time, or improve your time if you made it! Also - worth pointing out the \"big race\" coming to Singapore on 27 March: http://rpisg.com/futureplay-aerial-race/ This meetup will be the last organised meetup before the race, so get your race practice in with us now!! If you're not going to race - then at least turn up and support your fellow racers - for both events!! :) We'll be setting up a race course and fly in pairs / threes with simultaneous racing starts - and first past the post wins.  It's a little more competitive than the last race, but it'll be easier and more accurate to judge winners this way - and with prizes at stake - there's no room for error! As we'll be racing, please be patient and work with the organisers to keep everything safe and on schedule, that means not flying until it's your turn, being able to switch your transmitter frequency to an assigned channel, and not powering on your quad / transmitter while other's are flying. As always, the following rules apply: 1) Don't switch on your VTx without pre-announcing it to fliers currently in the air and waiting for their confirmation 2) Make sure you know your VTx frequency and are able to adjust it 3) During racing, if you're not currently racing do not switch on at all, until the current race is complete 4) Don't fly beyond your own abilities Read up on FPV etiquette! We're a friendly and encouraging group though, so even if you're a beginner we'll help you to get started. NB - This is a casual meetup and all attendees are responsible for their own safety and liability.  The organiser reserves all rights to determine winners and allocate prizes, and all decisions are final.","location":"Behind Outram Park MRT, 1A Pearl Bank, Singapore","latitude":1.282631,"longitude":103.839241,"rsvp_count":33,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/dronesg/events/228741980/","group_id":18318692,"group_name":"Singapore FPV Fun Meetup (Drone Fun)","group_url":"http://meetup.com/dronesg","formatted_time":"27 Feb 2016, Sat, 2:30 pm","start_time":"2016-02-27T06:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-02-27T10:30:00.000Z"}]}
