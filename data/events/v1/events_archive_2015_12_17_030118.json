Tools that were once designed to help people make decisions are being reimagined into products and services that actively make people's lives easier through anticipating what a user wants and making choices on their behalf. New smart products and services that anticipate user needs and make decisions according to our preferences with as little interaction as possible will release us from the tyranny of choice and give us more time to spend on the things that matter most.  Join UX Director Kieran Weston to learn about how the next wave of design thinking is creating a future of digital products and services that will noticeably improve our day to day lives and afford people more time for human experiences in a digital world. There will be snacks and drinks! Location: Huge's office is located at 33 Ann Siang Rd., Suite 31A. When you arrive, please check in with staff at the building entrance.  About the Speaker As UX Director at Huge Singapore, Kieran leads a multi-talented team of interaction designers and product designers to create digital products and services that people love. Kieran specialises in mobile interface design and has worked with international companies across finance (MetLife, Citibank, Standard Chartered), media and publishing (SBS, Astro, Elsevier, The Economist, Singapore Press Holdings), retail (Westfield, Woolworths), entertainment (Sydney Opera House) and government (Australian state government). Kieran has worked on large scale global projects with clients from China, Singapore, Australia and the UK. He prides himself on delivering solutions that create innovative and seamless interactions between business, technology and most importantly customers.
