However, what end users do not know is the legitimacy of the wireless network, which majority of end users do tend to ignore. Numerous security professionals have warned end users about the dangers of entering untrusted and unsecured networks, but end users still do not seem to understand the implications behind it. This talk will allow you to have a further understanding on why accessing such networks might endanger not only the end user, but also those who are connected to the end user digitally.\n \nAfter the talk, there will also be an exciting Capture-the-Flag (CTF) competition whereby you will be able to go through a series of challenges ranging from web exploitation to forensics, to obtain flags! More details will be given during the talk. There is no setup required for the workshop, just bring your laptop!\n \nThe Offensive Cyber Security Group is a student-driven initiative to promote awareness on cybersecurity for students in NTU. We conduct trainings and meetups with regards to the latest methodologies and tools for Offensive Tactics (e.g Ethical Hacking, Server Security). Sayed Hamzah from the group will be presenting to us this workshop.\n \nFacebook page of the OCSG:  https://www.facebook.com/ntucec0x0ffff5ec/\n\nRefreshments are provided!","location":"The Nest Theatre @ Innovation Centre","rsvp_count":29,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/223237724688915","group_name":"NTU Open Source Society","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/219467331408976","formatted_time":"19 Feb 2016, Fri, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2016-02-19T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-02-19T12:30:00.000Z"}]}
