Rather than a rigid presentation style, this will be a discussion and Q&amp;A on Nano Server and IoT, it will very likely have some demo, it will definitely be an \"ask Dan anything\" session so if you have PowerShell or Windows Management questions, now is your chance to ask. We may talk about DSC in Azure. Dan would love to connect with the Singapore community, please take advantage of this opportunity to bring your questions and feedback on all things PowerShell. Come and meet and hang out. Dan Harman is a Principal Program Manager at Microsoft in Redmond.","location":"Microsoft Singapore, One Marina Boulevard, Level 22, Meeting Room","latitude":0,"longitude":0,"rsvp_count":32,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/mssgug/events/227184655/","group_id":18429776,"group_name":"Microsoft User Groups (Singapore)","group_url":"http://meetup.com/mssgug","formatted_time":"09 Dec 2015, Wed, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2015-12-09T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-12-09T13:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"227129969","name":"Meetup with Ben Chan of Bitgo - MultiSignature Wallet Provider","description":"New to Bitcoin?  Here's a good video intro: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5JGQXCTe3c Let's close out 2015 with a fun night of beer and bitcoin!
