This technology is known as visible light communication, or \"Li-Fi\",  and is an integral component in the future of wireless communication. Li-Fi has been around for a few years, but hasn't yet reached the marketplace mainly because of its slow speed. At NUS, they have broken down this barrier by developing a plasmonic-enhanced LED bulb capable of streaming data up to 10x quicker than Wi-Fi. In this talk they will cover the basics of Li-Fi communication, their patented technology, and then open it up to the floor for a discussion.\n\nFree pizza as usual!\n\nhttp://nushackers.org/2016/02/friday-hacks-107-Feb-12/\n\nFriday Hacks is sponsored by the NUS Enterprise Center.\n\nIf you are looking to turn your ideas into a startup and would love some business support, feel free to get in touch with Agustiadi from NUS Enterprise: agustiadi@nus.edu.sg","location":"Video Conferencing Room, School of Computing, National University of Singapore","rsvp_count":12,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/535705849936703","group_name":"NUS Hackers","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/164904410234667","formatted_time":"12 Feb 2016, Fri, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2016-02-12T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-02-12T12:30:00.000Z"},{"id":"bblsmlyvdbqb","name":"UX TL;DR #3","description":"UX TL;DR is a learning event where everyone participates!

Is this something that can be made?\n\nYou don’t need advanced video editing skills, or the most expensive camera to get started with creating value-centric content for social media. All you need is a clear message and a smart phone at the very least.\n\nLearn the thought process behind designing video content that would resonate with your target audience, use your authentic voice to communicate a message and use a specific strategy to build your audience.\n\nThere will also be a Q&A session after the talk.\n\nRegister here\nhttps://www.eventbrite.sg/e/creative-crew-talks-feb-meeting-2016-tickets-20884588366","location":"Toa Payoh Public Library","rsvp_count":8,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/830738897037612","group_name":"Creative Crew Singapore","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/14431580201","formatted_time":"12 Feb 2016, Fri, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2016-02-12T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-02-12T12:30:00.000Z"},{"id":"162851474093652","name":"TGIFHacks #45","description":"This week at TGIFHacks, we will be learning the basics of arduino!\n\nArduino is an extremely popular microcontroller that has many various applications such as DIY technology, robotics, and even product design. \n\nIn this workshop, we will be teaching the basics of Arduino, and what are the possible things you could do with this small microcontroller.

This event is held by Lithan, titled Insights. (see https://www.lithan.com/ and the official event link at (http://sites.lithan.com/startupinsights/?src=meetup) There will be 2 keynote segments during the talk, with the thematic focus on Bitcoin and Blockchain application to startups.  This page has also been supported under, IoT Singapore, Singapore's largest and most active IoT group.  http://www.meetup.com/IoT_Singapore/ The first keynote speaker will be Meinhard Benn, who founded SatoshiPay, a bitcoin nanopayments processor aiming to fundamentally change the way web content is monetised. As open source developer, social entrepreneur and avid shoestring traveller with 50 countries under his belt, Meinhard experienced the need for a global and decentralised currency first-hand. He already experimented with different alternative monetary systems for years when bitcoin crossed his path in 2011. As miner, trader, developer and speaker he pushes the cryptocurrency ecosystem forward ever since.  https://satoshipay.io/ The second keynote speaker will be myself, Shaun Djie, co-lead organiser of this group and a Business Development specialist at DigixGlobal, our page's sponsor. I will be speaking from an educational perspective to the budding entrepreneurs at the event (as SBUC is largely student, academic attendees in general), and describing the business model and products offered at DigixGlobal.  https://dgx.io/ I will be confirming more details of this event in the very near future, and look forward to answering any questions you may have through the forum. I've created a Slack channel, the domain name is ethereumSG.slack.com, alternatively, you may drop your email in the comment box below and I can send you an invite. See you on Slack and at the event, Best Regards,Shaun Djie","location":"Lithan Accelerator, Launchpad@one-north Blk 79, Ayer Rajah Crescent #04-04 Singapore 139955 ","latitude":1.29796,"longitude":103.787453,"rsvp_count":64,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/Ethereum-Singapore/events/228341964/","group_id":18519858,"group_name":"Ethereum Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Ethereum-Singapore","formatted_time":"12 Feb 2016, Fri, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2016-02-12T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-02-12T14:00:00.000Z"}]}
