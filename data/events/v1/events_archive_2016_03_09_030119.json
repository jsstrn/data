The lecture talks about the dangers of putting our faith in compilers which programmers are too quick to trust and take for granted.\n\nKheng Meng will give this talk once more this time infused with live C-programming proof-of-concept demos to the audience to better illustrate this attack. A threat detection technique and its pitfalls will also be touched on to detect the presence of such an attack vector.\n\nSpeaker's Biography:\nKheng Meng graduated from NUS Computer Science in 2015. He was also the developer of both the Android and iOS versions of the NUS SoC Print apps. He is currently working in Algo Access, a local med-tech startup as both a software and hardware engineer in iOS development and electronics design.","location":"NUS School of Computing - COM1-0210 (SR10)","rsvp_count":14,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/457900001062885","group_name":"NUS Grey Hats","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/1580364462185109","formatted_time":"09 Mar 2016, Wed, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2016-03-09T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-03-09T12:30:00.000Z"},{"id":"229113409","name":"March Meetup 2016","description":"Hello!

Agenda 1. ReactJS with Django Abstract: ReactJS is an amazing new front-end framework developed by Facebook. Unfortunately, if you are new to JavaScript it is quite hard to setup and even harder to integrate with Django. Martin will demonstrate all necessary steps to implement and deploy your first little React components and hook them up with your existing Django website. The beauty of this approach is, that you can start with very small components and \"reactify\" your existing site in small steps, one component at a time, no big project migration is needed. Speaker: Martin Brochhaus \nMartin has been creating web applications for more than 15 years using various programming languages along the way. In 2010 he discovered the Python programming language and immediately fell in love. In Singapore he founded the web development agency \"Bitmazk Pte Ltd\" and has since helped various clients and startups around the globe to get off the ground using modules and frameworks from Python's rich ecosystem. Martin is an open source enthusiast with more than 150 repositories on GitHub and a very active member of the local Python User Group Singapore. He has been on the organizing committee of PyCon Singapore for the past three years and is currently fostering PyLadies Singapore to help more women to get into software development. 2. TDD with pytest Abstract: Learning TDD practice in Python can be challenging because there are several \"competing\" packages without an obvious \"best way\" to do it. Simplicity and readability arecore concepts in Python. In this talk I will try to show how it can be applied to testing by doing a side-by-side comparison of unittest/selenium vs pytest/splinter in a simple web application development context. \n\nSpeaker:  Ivan Zimine Ivan earned his PhD in Physics in 2003 from University of Geneva, Switzerland.He spent 13 years doing academic research in medical physics, but then decidedthat he really preferred writing software to scientific papers, and moved to ITfield. He has been an active member of the Python User Group Singapore since2011. \n\n\n3. Singapore's Open Developer Event Statistics Abstract:https://data.webuild.sg/: In this talk we will go through some statistics about Singapore's open developer events and open source projects through charts, graphs and some numbers. Ever wondered how many active developer groups are there? Or which are the Python open source projects that local developers are contributing to? More importantly, how can you get involved in this growing story of a young developer community? We will have fun and explore more through data! \n\n\nSpeaker: Sayanee Basu Sayanee is an engineer with a focus on web technologies and electronics. She makes screencasts on developer tools called Build Podcast (http://build-podcast.com/), curates Singapore's developer community with We Build SG (https://webuild.sg/) and monitors her Basil plant (http://basil.sayan.ee/) while dabbling with soldering, WiFi and Web Sockets.","location":"Red Hat, 8 Shenton Way, 10-01 AXA Tower, 068811 Singapore","rsvp_count":60,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Python-User-Group/events/229113409/","group_id":18417697,"group_name":"Singapore Python User Group","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Singapore-Python-User-Group","formatted_time":"09 Mar 2016, Wed, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2016-03-09T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-03-09T13:00:00.000Z","latitude":1.27575,"longitude":103.847198},{"id":"228749955","name":"Test Automation Workshop (Serenity BDD)","description":"Bring your Laptops!
