If you're interesting in giving a talk to the BTC community in SG, sharing your idea &amp; startup, getting beta users, etc., let me know. We're looking to have a few meetups with awesome speakers &amp; thought leaders starting the night's conversation. -------- Side note: Sarnie's cafe accepts Bitcoin, and they're really being cool by giving us so much of their space at peak hours to have our meetup there. So, it's cool and supportive if you order from their menu (for bitcoin, of course). They also happen to make shockingly delicious food (I highly recommend the Chicken In A Paper Bag), and damn good coffee (their own custom house blend).","location":"Sarnies, 136 Telok Ayer , Singapore","latitude":1.28166,"longitude":103.8479,"rsvp_count":10,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/BitcoinSingapore/events/229249978/","group_id":8103652,"group_name":"Bitcoins in Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/BitcoinSingapore","formatted_time":"02 Mar 2016, Wed, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2016-03-02T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-03-02T13:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"228963994","name":"Singapore Clojure Meetup #8 Getting started with Boot/ONYX Distributed computing","description":"Our Second Clojure Meetup this year and we have something for everyone, Jethro Kuan will take use through starting to use Boot. If you have never used Java before Boot takes build tooling and gives it a Clojure makeover so that you will be cranking out JARs like a pro in record time. Lucas Bradstreet , a core developer of Onyx will give us the lowdown on the ONYX distributed computing Clojure library, think of it as a supercharger for BIG DATA among many other possible use cases. Getting Started with Boot: Boot is build tooling for Clojure and this talk will take you through the initial steps to get started using Boot Jethro Kuan Just a Clojure hobbyist, or computer hobbyist in general. Coming back to programming after a 2 year dry spell. He has a half a year of Clojure experience, with 3 months of toying around and 3 months of building things. No formal education on computer science (yet), started interning at Tinkertanker, where I use Clojure to build simple Slack integrations. Onyx: Data Driven Distributed Computing in Clojure: Onyx is a new distributed, masterless, fault tolerant computation platform written specifically with Clojure developers in mind. It gracefully composes many concerns: computational structure, data flow, stateful lifecycles, deployment, and more. Its superpower is its ability to create distributed workflows at runtime in an ad-hoc fashion. In effect, Onyx allows you to bridge the gap across programming languages, execution environments, machines, and time. Lucas Bradstreet is a core developer on OnyxÂ www.onyxplatform.org, an open source distributed batch and streaming platform built in, and for, Clojure. He works at Distributed Masonry, the stewards of the Onyx \n\n\nPayPal are kindly hosting us this month and also supplying the food (pizza)!","location":"Paypal at Suntec , 5 Temasek Blvd, #07-01 Suntec Tower Five, Nearest Mrt:Promenade(Yellow Line), Singapore","latitude":1.2945,"longitude":103.857964,"rsvp_count":41,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Clojure-Meetup/events/228963994/","group_id":18616301,"group_name":"Singapore Clojure Meetup","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Singapore-Clojure-Meetup","formatted_time":"02 Mar 2016, Wed, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2016-03-02T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-03-02T13:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"1103905549641078","name":"Digital Music Synthesis and [De-]obfuscating Javascript: HackerspaceSG GeekUp March 2016","description":"As a more technical companion to our Awesome Talks series on the 3rd Wednesday of each month, we're adding HackerspaceSG GeekUp on the 1st Wednesday of each month. For the first run, we have Prasanna Kanagasabai and Dirk Stromberg.\n\n---\n\nJavaScript Obfuscation\nPrasanna K\n\nJavaScript Obfuscation demystified. Everyone writing JavaScript knows that there are multiple ways of doing the same thing. Developers build filters to catch malicious JavaScript, but a wily attacker can obfuscate JavaScript so that filters can be bypassed.\n\nThis session will teach participants multiple JavaScript implementation details and how these are used to build obfuscated code. We will also discuss how to dissect already obfuscated code. The session is divided into two parts: first part will expose participants to different components of JavaScript internals and how they can be used to create obfuscated code. The second part will help them to decipher obfuscated code.\n\n---\n\nMusic Synthesis Deep-Dive\nDirk Stromberg\n\nDirk explained why he creates and own instruments and showed off his Phallophone and Strombophone at this month's HackerspaceSG Awesome Talks. For HackerspaceSG Geek Up, he'll take us through how the instruments actually work. He may even be tempted to give us another live demo!","location":"HackerspaceSG","rsvp_count":21,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1103905549641078","group_name":"HackerspaceSG","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/189278128103","formatted_time":"02 Mar 2016, Wed, 8:00 pm","start_time":"2016-03-02T12:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-03-02T14:00:00.000Z"}]}
