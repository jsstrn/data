Agenda • The Anatomy of Deep Learning Networks - Raymond Chan  Raymond will dissect the workings of a simple multi-layer neural network (rebranded as Deep Learning) from the view point of non-linear regression.  • Equity Option Implied Volatility Analytics with Python - Jason Strimpel Python has become an increasingly important tool in the domain of quantitative and algorithmic trading and research. This extends from senior quantitative analysts pricing complex derivatives using numerical techniques all the way to the retail trader using closed form valuation methods and analysis techniques. This talk will focus on the uses of Python in discovering unobserved features of listed equity options. The Black-Scholes option pricing formula was first published in 1973 in a paper called \"The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities\". In that paper Fischer Black and Myron Scholes derived an equation which estimates the price of an option over time. This formula and its associated \"greeks\" have become ubiquitous in options trading. In this talk, we'll demonstrate how to gather options data using the Pandas module and apply various transformations to obtain the theoretical value of the option and the associated greeks. We'll then extend the talk to discuss implied volatility and show how to use Numpy methods to compute implied volatility. We'll use the results to visualize the so-called volatility skew and term structure to help inform potential trading decisions. • Short lightning talks, if any (max 5 mins each) • PyData/Data Science jobs (max 5 mins) Updates • PyCon Singapore 2016 CFP is open! • We are officially listed on the main PyData Meetups page!

There are absolutely no fees. Just come with an open mind and willingness to share and learn Agenda:  Introduction &amp; Networking : 15 mins News Bytes : 15 mins IoT Product Life-Cycle and Security by Oliver Banks and Cyber Crime by Nicolas Collery  Abstract of the talk(s): 1. News BytesIt will cover the latest news on information security that were in headlines in last month. 2. IoT Product Life-Cycle and Security Security is considered the number one technological challenge for the Internet of Things. We'll try to give a holistic view of security in IoT and the challenges faced by IoT device and solution companies. 3. Banks and cybercrime Cybercrime is a serious matter! However, in this presentation we will see a-not-so-serious interpretation for our leisure. Oftentimes incident response is portrayed from the victim's perspective but rarely from the bank's. Together we will see in a casual way (not too technical - unless required) some crimes bank's customers are facing. It includes defacement, fake banks, phishing and malware (internet and mobile banking). Threat actors will also be identified (main persona - not individual).  Speaker(s) Bio: Oliver is the CTO of RemoteGrid Pte Ltd, a Singapore based start-up in precision agriculture. Oliver has more than 10 years of experience in building networked systems. Applications he has developed range from in-vehicle networks to sensor networks. Prior to joining RemoteGrid he worked as a program manager in Microsoft’s IoT Group in Beijing.  Nicolas Collery, a senior security incident responder with a focus on cyber criminals TTP (tools, techniques and procedures), is working for one of the leading banks in Singapore. He has analysed enough attacks since 2007 to be considered a subject matter expert in his day-to-day operations. His favourite past-time and passion after work is to analyse malware as well as to understand more about the mindset of criminals and the latest techniques used. Nicolas finds malware and sophisticated attacks to be of interest from the technical perspective, but traditional attacks also fascinates him because they are still effective despite the simplicity.

This week we'll be covering the chapters on Io.  \n\n\n\"Just as each new spoken language can make you smarter and increase your options, each programming language increases your mental tool kit, adding new abstractions you can throw at each new problem. \" How Book Club Works1. Read the chapter before you come to the meetup.2. Find something in the chapter you found interesting and maybe research it a little more.3. At the meetup, we go around the room and each person gets a chance to tell the group about the thing they found interesting.4. Group discussion and banter ensues!
