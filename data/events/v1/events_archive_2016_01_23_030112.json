We'll be setting up a race course, simple one for beginners and a more advanced one for those who like a challenge. We'll fly in pairs / threes with staggered starts and time trials, and hopefully get some sort of tournament leaderboard going. As we'll be racing, please be patient and work with the organisers to keep everything safe and on schedule, that means not flying until it's your turn, and being able to switch your transmitter frequency to an assigned channel. As always, the following rules apply: 1) Don't switch on your VTx without pre-announcing it to fliers currently in the air and waiting for their confirmation 2) Make sure you know your VTx frequency and are able to adjust it 3) During racing, if you're not currently racing do not switch on at all, until the current race is complete 4) Don't fly beyond your own abilities Read up on FPV etiquette! We're a friendly and encouraging group though, so even if you're a beginner we'll help you to get started. NB - This is a casual meetup and all attendees are responsible for their own safety and liability.","location":"Behind Outram Park MRT, 1A Pearl Bank, Singapore","latitude":1.283485,"longitude":103.83818,"rsvp_count":39,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/dronesg/events/227881794/","group_id":18318692,"group_name":"Singapore FPV Fun Meetup (Drone Fun)","group_url":"http://meetup.com/dronesg","formatted_time":"23 Jan 2016, Sat, 4:00 pm","start_time":"2016-01-23T08:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-01-23T11:00:00.000Z"}]}
