This huge workload requires an efficient file store engine. They chose BeansDB in the beginning, but did not find it appropriate when used in the high speed cache system. Finally, they decide to rewrite it in Go language. Although Go is much simpler and more a pleasure to write compared with C, it also introduces a new problem, the GC issue. In this talk, Cheng Wei will go deep in this topic and share the best practices they learnt in reducing GC overhead. Meanwhile, they also show that the Go GC system is still continuous evolving thanks to the effort of Go dev team.\n\nSpeaker’s Profile\n\nCheng Wei obtained his PhD degree from School of Computing, NUS on 2010, and then joined Garena and involved in various of projects there. Since 2013, he worked as server team leader of BeeTalk, a social app having tens of millions of active users. He likes learning new programming languages and is also keen on profiling and optimizing the performance of server programs.\n\nFree pizza as usual! \nPlus free sushi this week!\n\nhttp://nushackers.org/2016/02/friday-hacks-108-March-4\n\nFriday Hacks is sponsored by the NUS Enterprise Center.\n\nIf you are looking to turn your ideas into a startup and would love some business support, feel free to get in touch with Agustiadi from NUS Enterprise: agustiadi@nus.edu.sg","location":"SR3, Town Plaza, University Town, National University of Singapore","rsvp_count":20,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1664420683812357","group_name":"NUS Hackers","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/164904410234667","formatted_time":"04 Mar 2016, Fri, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2016-03-04T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-03-04T12:30:00.000Z"}]}
