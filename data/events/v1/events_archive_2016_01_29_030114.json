From small web applications to desktop applications. From small libraries to browser add-ons. From basic demo projects to web-based multiplayer games. Some of his interesting projects include: life (a timeline viewer), hackerweb (a readable HackerNews web app) and MooEditable (a simple web-based WYSIWYG editor). More of his projects here: http://cheeaun.github.io/. More of his side projects adventures here: http://cheeaun.com/blog/2016/01/building-side-projects/.\n\n# Speaker Profile\n\nLim Chee Aun is a web developer from Malaysia, currently based in Singapore. He can design and code at same time, well, realistically one at a time. He dabbles around with mostly front-end technologies, always keeping up-to-date with the latest products, constantly learning new things and never stopping to build useful applications for himself and other people.","location":"Video Conference Room (COM1-02-13), School of Computing, National University of Singapore","rsvp_count":16,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1694849550727367","group_name":"NUS Hackers","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/164904410234667","formatted_time":"29 Jan 2016, Fri, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2016-01-29T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-01-29T12:30:00.000Z"},{"id":"1540152856297990","name":"TGIFHacks #44 - RESTful Web API","description":"This week, at TGIFHacks, we will present to you how to design a RESTful API with Django and Python. \n\nRESTful API is a web API, which are interfaces for people to use web services conveniently\n\nDo come down to our workshop as long as you are interested in developing an web API!\n\nThere is no setup required for this workshop, just bring your laptop with a browser!","location":"NTU Open Source Society","rsvp_count":19,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1540152856297990","group_name":"NTU Open Source Society","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/219467331408976","formatted_time":"29 Jan 2016, Fri, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2016-01-29T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-01-29T12:30:00.000Z"},{"id":"227665694","name":"Shapeways Singapore Meetup","description":"Time to ring in the new year with our first Singapore Shapeways Meetup for the 2016!
