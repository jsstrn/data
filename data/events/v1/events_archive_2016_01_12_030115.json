In this talk, 2 speakers share one application — the idea that, now people could design and print their own 3D products. They will bring their first 3D printer, tour us through the possibilities of 3D printing and learn their journey on how they got started with the whole 3D printing process. There will be demos as well as samples of items that they have 3D printed.\nThis session is for all who have heard of 3D printing or seen 3D printing and thinking of trying out yourselves. There will also be a Q&A session after the talk.\n\nRegister Here\nhttps://www.eventbrite.sg/e/creative-crew-talks-jan-meeting-2016-tickets-20411008877","location":"Toa Payoh Public Library","rsvp_count":11,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/940864312635713","group_name":"Creative Crew Singapore","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/14431580201","formatted_time":"12 Jan 2016, Tue, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2016-01-12T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-01-12T12:30:00.000Z"},{"id":"227932302","name":"Book Club: Seven Languages in Seven Weeks – Ruby","description":"Read Seven Languages in Seven Weeks.

Read the chapter before you come to the meetup.2. Find something in the chapter you found interesting and maybe research it a little more.3. At the meetup, we go around the room and each person gets a chance to tell the group about the thing they found interesting.4. Group discussion and banter ensues!
