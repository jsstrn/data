This talk will focus on showcasing techniques to visually explore multidimensional data (p &gt; 3). The aim is to show examples of each of the following techniques, potentially using one exemplar dataset. The talk will also explore the role of interaction approaches to enhance our ability to visually explore the multidimensional data.
