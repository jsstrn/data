There are absolutely no fees. Just come with an open mind and willingness to share and learn** \n\n\nAgenda:  Introduction &amp; Networking : 15 mins Three lessons that I learnt from Rowhammer - with implications for future security research by Thomas Dullien aka Halvar Flake, Google. ( 45 minutes including Q &amp; A ) \n\n\nOur Awesome Speaker: Thomas Dullien aka Halvar Flake: @halvarflake Who wouldn't know about Halvar Flake in security ?  Halvar Flake / Thomas Dullien has been working in reverse engineering and computer security / vulnerability developmentfor close to 18 years. He has repeatedly contributed innovative research - ranging from heap exploitation over patch diffingto automated malware analysis, large scale malware clustering, to innovative exploitation of physical phenomena in DRAMchips. He founded zynamics in 2004 - a company specializing in reverse engineering tools - which was acquired by Googlein 2011. He spent 4.5 years at Google and is currently taking a year of break from everything to travel, read, and surf. \n\n\nSome of his talks: Area41 - Keynote: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kG2sISGNZmk https://www.blackhat.com/us-15/briefings.html#exploiting-the-dram-rowhammer-bug-to-gain-kernel-privileges  https://www.crunchbase.com/person/thomas-dullien  and many more talks, we couldn't list here :) Follow us on twitter @nullsingapore and fb at facebook.com/nullsingapore.","location":"EY #19-01 Training Room , The Arcade, 11 Collyer Quay, Singapore","latitude":1.28403,"longitude":103.85183,"rsvp_count":73,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/Null-Singapore-The-Open-Security-Community/events/229196202/","group_id":18493025,"group_name":"Null Singapore - The Open Security Community","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Null-Singapore-The-Open-Security-Community","formatted_time":"03 Mar 2016, Thu, 6:45 pm","start_time":"2016-03-03T10:45:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-03-03T12:45:00.000Z"},{"id":"228700815","name":"Intro to Cisco Microservices Integrated Dev Env & Container-based PaaS Platform","description":"We stand on the brink of huge advances that will define the next-generation cloud infrastructure. The new architecture for Internet applications with microservices running in containers on cloud will vastly improve hardware utilization and accelerate application development and deployment. Hyperscale Internet giants like Google, Twitter, Netflix and Facebook have already put those technologies into production by building their own solutions and reaping the benefits.But when you're deploying microservices, you'll soon run into problems. How do you maintain code and deployment? Where should you run which service? How do you connect them together? Where should you store configuration? Where should the logs go?Cisco has released an integrated micro services development environment and an open source portable container-based PaaS environment called Project Shipped(ciscoshipped.io) and Mantl (Mantl.io) that aims to solve these challenges an lay foundation for the next-generation cloud infrastructure.We are extremely fortunate to have Matt Johnson (Principal Engineer, Cisco Worldwide CTO Office) to come share with us Cisco Project Shipped and Mantl. We have only limited spaces so please register early. Beer and Pizza will be provided as usual.
