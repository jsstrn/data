Using machine learning technology, semantic classifiers recognize many visual entities, such as settings, objects, and events Watson Analytics session will be covered by Pragyan. You will learn how to leverage on Watson Analytics to analyze historical transactions of a bike sharing company and predict future sales. She will talk and give a demo about tools in Watson Analytics to do data exploration and creation of dashboard, visualizing the insights.  About Speaker Pragyan is currently working at IBM as a data analytics intern. She together with her team won the Bluemix Award category of Singapore Airlines App Challenge in October 2015. She is a student of Master of Technology in Business Analytics from NUS and has good understanding of both business and technology. She is skilled at two major differentials in the business decision making: critical analysis of the problem and effective management of the information.","location":"NUS Enterprise@Blk71, 71 Ayer Rajah Crescent, #02-01, Singapore 139951","latitude":1.2969,"longitude":103.786369,"rsvp_count":31,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/bluemixsg/events/228105199/","group_id":18509757,"group_name":"Bluemix Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/bluemixsg","formatted_time":"28 Jan 2016, Thu, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2016-01-28T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-01-28T13:30:00.000Z"},{"id":"227317689","name":"Analytics.CLUB Monthly Meet-N-Greet Mixer","description":"Analytics.Club's Monthly Meet-N-Greet Mixer About the Event: Monthly Meet-N-Greet Mixer networking event is conducted every last Thursday of the month.

If, like me, you imagine a horrible tangled mess, then this talk will open your eyes to a whole new way of thinking about parsing that fully embraces functional programming to elegantly build parsers from simple, composable building blocks. In this talk Ravi will discuss: - An overview of parsing techniques. - What are parser combinators? - Understanding default scala parser combinator api - Combinators in other languages - Performance of parser combinators This will be an interactive session with code examples for you to work on so please bring laptops with a working Scala development environment set up.
